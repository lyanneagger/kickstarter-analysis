# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis will identify trends among previous fundraising campaigns to determine success based on launch dates and goals. This information will be visualized to show the months that have proven most or least successful as well as which range of goals were most or least successful.



## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analysis of fundraising campaigns based on launch date examines 1369 theater crowdfunding campaigns. Campaigns were categorized by successful, failed, or canceled and organized by their month of launch to identify trends in launch date and outcome. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Analysis of outcomes based on goals compares 1047 crowdfunding campaigns for plays to identify trends in goals set in successful campaigns. The number of successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns was broken down into different ranges of goals to identify which was most successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on outcomes compared to launch date, May and June are the most successful months to begin a campaign. In May, 111 successful campaigns and 52 failed campaigns were launched. In June, 100 successful campaigns and 49 failed campaigns were launched. 

Campaigns launched in December had the lowest success rate and almost an equal number of successes and failures. The rest of the year saw more success and greater odds of success over failure.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

In examining outcomes based on goals, the most successful campaigns, both in number and percentage, were started with a goal of less than $1,000 or between $1,000 and $4,999. Campaigns with a goal under $1,000 were successful 76% of the time, with 141 campaigns achieving their fundraising goals. Campaigns with goals between $1,000 and $4,999 were successful 73% of the time, with 388 campaigns achieving their goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
